			Parking has long been an important part of the infrastructure of modern residential neighbourhoods. And those being in search of new dwelling in most cases pay attention to newly-built apartment blocks with the underground parking - such as, at the CHICAGO Central House Residential Estate.
		</p>
				<h2>Advantages of Underground Parking </h2>
				<p>

	Each driver knows what it is like to dig a car out from under the snow in winter or what it is like trying to reach your car, left on the street, in rainy autumn, and to make things worse, far away from home. The perfect solution to such problems is the underground heated parking located right under the building.
	</p>
				<p>
        Leaving your car under the roof and in warmth will make the car to serve its owner much longer. In the winter, such car will warm up faster, spending less fuel. In this case, the owner will not freeze in a cold cabin, because it is always warm in the parking space. It is worth mentioning that obligatory winter attributes such as cleaning the vehicle body from the ice cover and snow - all this will remain just an annoying flashback with the heated parking.
